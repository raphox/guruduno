Do you like to play Uno, Mattel's famous card game? If so, you'll love discovering the new web and mobile application that lets you clear all your doubts about the rules, special cards and the best strategies to beat your opponents.

The application is called 'Guruduno' (that's right, it's not 'Guru do Uno') and it is an interactive platform where you can access several questions previously asked by other users and also have the option to ask new questions which are answered via integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence capable of generating coherent and relevant responses.

With 'Guruduno', you can learn more about the card game Uno, have fun with the curiosities and challenges proposed by ChatGPT and even share your experiences and tips with other fans of the game. The app is free and available for all major web browsers and mobile operating systems.

You also have access to all official game rules in the rules menu.

## Other information

This app was created as a proof of concept to test the feasibility of developing a question and answer system based on official documentation. This documentation is stored in a database that serves as a source for ChatGPT to interpret the user's questions and respond according to the available information.

For example, you can use this application to create a chatbot that answers questions about a specific product or service, using the official product or service documentation as a source of information. Or you can use this application to create a chatbot that answers questions about a topic of general interest, using a database of articles or books on the topic as a source of information. Or you can use this app to create a chatbot that answers questions about a famous personality, using a database of biographies or interviews about the personality as the source of information.

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the potential of ChatGPT to generate coherent and relevant responses from a structured and updated database. You can explore the different functionalities of the app and ask any questions you want. We hope you enjoy this experience and give us your feedback.
