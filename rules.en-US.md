## Purpose of the Game:

Be the first player to get rid of all your cards in each round and earn points for your opponents' remaining cards.

The points of each round are accumulated and the first player to reach 500 points will be the winner.

## Preparation:

1. Each player draws a card. Whoever rolls the highest number will do the distribution.
2. The player dealing the cards shuffles and deals 7 cards each (if the *White Wild Card to Customize* cards are not already written, leave them out of the game).
3. The remaining cards must be placed face down, forming the *Buy* pile.
4. The top card of the *Purchase* pile is turned over to form the *Discard* pile.

> **Note:** If any of the *Action Cards** (symbols) is flipped over to start the *Discard* de, see **Card Functions and and Action** for special instructions.

## Let's Play:

The player to the left of the one dealing the cards starts the game, and the game must continue clockwise. On your turn, you must match a card from your hand with the one on top of the *Discard* pile, either by number, color or symbol (symbols represent *Action Cards*: see **Functions of Cards and and Action** ). This must be repeated with all subsequent players, throughout all rounds, until someone runs out of cards in their hand.

> **Example:** If the card in the *Discard* pile is a blue 7, the player must play a Blue card of any number.

There are several rules that make you remove cards from the pile as punishment. If you play a card that you shouldn't, if you forget to shout UNO every time you have only one card left in your hand, or if you try to persuade one of the players to play a card that favors you, you will have to take two cards from the pile.

Another rule to keep in mind is that during your turn, the player can draw a card from the pile. However, if he chooses to remove a card, the player cannot change his mind and play a card he already has in his hand.

If the player does not have cards in his hand corresponding to those on the table, he must draw a card from the pile. If any card matching in number or color comes out, the player can play the card. The player can also choose not to use the card that came out of the pile, in luck.

Some UNO decks come with white cards. If there are those who think that they are bonus cards that can take on any card that the player needs at that moment, the truth is that they only serve to replace cards that the owner of the deck has lost. However, the instructions themselves appeal to players' creativity to create new rules for these cards.

## Functions of Action Cards:

Action cards, as the name implies, serve to give the game a buzz. Whether to make opponents draw cards, change the current color of the round or simply create a new rule.

- **Draw Two Cards (or +2):** When this card is played, the next player must draw 2 cards and lose their turn. It can only be played on a matching color or on another "Draw Two Card" card. The same rule applies if it is tapped at the start of the game.
- **Invert (or Reverse):** When you discard this card, the direction of the game is reversed (if it is going left, it changes to the right and vice versa). Eal can only be played on a matching color or on another reverse card. If the card is turned over at the start of the game, the one who dealt the cards plays first and the game continues counterclockwise instead of clockwise.
- **Skip:** When you play this card, the next player is skipped (loses turn). It can only be played on a matching color or on another Skip card. If a Skip card is flipped at the start of the game, the player to the left of the dealer is skipped. In this case, the player to his left will start.
- **Joker:** When you play this card, you choose the color that will continue the game (it can be any color, including the one that was being played before the Joker). You can play a Joker on your turn, even if you have another matching card in your hand. If the Joker is turned over at the start of the game, the person to the left of the one who dealt the cards chooses which color the game should start with. Can be played on any card.
- **Wild Draw Four Cards (or +4):** When playing this card, you can choose which color to play in addition to making the next player have to draw 4 cards from the *Draw* pile, also losing the turn. But there is a detail! This card can only be played when you don't have another card that matches the color in the discard pile (however, it can be discarded if you have a card with the matching number or another Action Card). If it is tapped at the start of the game, place it in the middle of the pile and take another card. Can be played on any card.

> **Note:** If you suspect that a *Wild Draw Four Card* card has been played against you dishonestly (for example, when the player has a card of a matching color), you can challenge him. The challenged player must show his face to the person who challenged him. If he cheated, he will have to draw the 4 cards. However, if the player is challenged and has not cheated, you must draw all 4 cards and 2 more cards. The player must only show his cards to the person who proposed the challenge.

- **Wild Switch Hands:** This card is an example of something you can do to customize your own white cards. When playing this card, you can choose the color to be played next in addition to exchanging your cards with another player's cards. If it is tapped at the start of the game, place it in the middle of the pile and take another card.
- **White Wild Card to Customize:** This card serves as a *Wild Card* in addition to allowing players to pencil in any rule they wish. If it is tapped at the start of the game, place it in the middle of the pile and take another card.

## Finishing:

When playing your penultimate card, you must shout "UNO" to indicate that you only have one card in your hand. If you don't shout "UNO" and someone notices before the next player starts playing, you will have to draw two cards.

When a player has run out of cards, the round ends. The points are then added up (see **Score**) and the player starts again.

If the last card played in a round is *Draw Two Cards* or *Wild Card Draw 4 Cards*, the next player must draw 2 or 4 cards, according to the commanded action. They will be counted in the sum of points.

The *Wild Switch Hands* card cannot be played as the last card.

If no player has finished their cards when the *Purchase* pile runs out, the *Discard* pile must be shuffled again for the game to continue.

## Punctuation:

- All numbered cards (0 to 9): Face Value
- Draw Two Cards: 20 Points:
- Reverse: 20 Points;
- Jump: 20 Points;
- Joker: 50 Points:
- Joker Draw Four Cards: 50 Points;
- Joker Swap Hands: 50 Points:
- White Joker to Customize: 50 Points.

If, after counting, it is found that no player has reached 500 points, it will be necessary to shuffle again and start a new round.

## Winning the Game:

The winner is the first to score 500 points.

## Alternative Point Counting:

Another way to keep track of the score is to keep track of the cards left with each player at the end of each round. When a player reaches 500 points, the one with the lowest score will be the winner.

## Main questions about the rules of Uno

As rules are often passed on by word of mouth, many doubts arise. Some of the main doubts are about the overlapping of the +4, +4 and +2 cards, what happens if you don't shout "UNO", among others. And, of course, we'll answer them all!

1. **Combination of +4 and +2 cards**

A person dealt a *Draw Four Card Wild* card cannot play a *Draw Two Card* card on top, causing the next person to draw six cards.

According to the official rule, when receiving the * Wild Draw Four Cards *, the player loses his turn and draws all four cards.

2. **Combination of +4 and +4 cards**

The movement of playing a *Draw Four Card Wild Card* (+4) over another equal card (another +4) is not allowed, as per the official rules of the game.

It is also worth noting that the card *Wild Draw Four Cards* can only be used when the player does not have any card corresponding to the one on the table in his hand. If he cheats and is found out, he will have to draw the cards.

3. **Combination +2 and +2**

Unlike the rules above, it is allowed to play a Buy Two (+2) card on top of the same card, even if they are of different colors.

4. **Inverter (or Reverse) card in double**

When playing in a double, the *Flip* card has the same effect as the Skip card. That is, the other player loses his turn.

5. **Do not shout "UNO"**

If you don't yell "UNO!" when you put the penultimate card of your hand on the table and someone notices, you will have to draw two cards. But be careful: you only have to do this if they notice it before the next player plays the card. If you go after that, you won't have to buy anything.

6. **Playing the wrong card**

Whoever plays the wrong card pays. Or rather: buy! Whoever does this will have to draw two cards from the pile.

7. **Buy multiple cards**

If the person doesn't have a card to play on the table, he needs to draw one from the pile. What a lot of people don't know is that the player doesn't have to draw cards until they get one that can be played.

According to the official rules, you only have to draw one, and even if it's a good card for the game, you don't have to play it.
